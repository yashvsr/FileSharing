# FileSharing
File Sharing app using Python
One of the biggest problems I find with any commercial app is you never know whoâ€™s accessing your personal information. Anything shared among people on the internet will always be subject to attacks, like those of MITM.

File transfer is the process of copying or moving a file from one computer to another over a network or Internet connection. The basic idea is to create a server that listens on a particular port; this server will be responsible for receiving files (you can make the server send files as well). On the other hand, the client will try to connect to the server and send a file of any type.

We will use the socket module, which comes built-in with Python and provides us with socket operations that are widely used on the Internet, as they are behind any connection to any network.
